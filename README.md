# CodeSamples - A brief portfolio

This script repo contains a number of scripts written for desktop management purposes in an Enterprise environment. 

Only client data has been removed. 

The scripts are from various periods throughout my development of my understanding of scripting, so some frankly are better than others.

As production scripts, README files are largely irrelevant, techs and agents on phone calls will not read them anyway. Instructions were provided to the target user base directly or via email / messaging. All notation is within the scripts themselves.
